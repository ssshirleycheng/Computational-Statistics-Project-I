ProjectI: Analysis Kindergarten Student's Reading Readiness
Handle missing data. Use Pre-K Test results(R-Score and L-Score) to analyze student's reading ability. Associated with 
statistics of DIEBLS, check if the Pre-K Test result can accurately predict student's reading ability.
ProjectII: Analysis of Boston house price
Use parallel coordinates plot and scatterplots matrix to visualize variable relationship in the dataset. Clean the Data,
Transform the data by taking the logarithm or raising the variables to the power of something smaller than one helps to 
reduce the asymmetry. Then preform Best Subset Selection method, lasso regression method and ridge regression method where 
I evaluate the preformance of model by validation set error, cross-validation. Ultimately I choose what I thought was best 
model and the most significant features, then predict the rest dataset's house price.
